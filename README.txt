# Thermal_sensor_human_detection


In this repository is located thermal sensor based human detection model project, which is the final academic work in the IAS0360 Machine Learning for Embedded Systems course at Tallinn University of Technology.
TODO: add aim of the project and comments about unlabeled dataset.

In this repository is located thermal sensor based human detection model project, which purpose is to develop a model that detects whether there is a real human in front of the sensor. Thermal sensor used in experiment outputs 32x32 array that measures temperature up to 6 meters from the sensor. Thermal sensor is attached to the ceiling of the room (room tempperature is 15 degrees per Celsium) and measures any warm object temperature that emits heat.

Project description: (is this part needed?)

Model results:
TODO: add model evaluation description and results from Uljana

Repository description:
TODO: add decription of each subfolder and that project flow is described in Conference paper

Tools used:
TODO: add what libraries and software were used
C-project is written with CubeMX tool (?)
